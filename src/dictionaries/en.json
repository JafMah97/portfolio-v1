I implemented a full authentication system (email confirmation, password reset, magic links, secure login/logout), although the UI flows UI flows that require email functionality are not active in production because email APIs require a live domain and SMTP is blocked on free hosting tiers.Despite those limitations, the entire system is fully implemented in code and demonstrates real‑world architecture, protected routes, optimistic UI updates, and multilingual support (Arabic + English).",

I built it using a hands-on, iterative approach—experimenting, breaking things, fixing them, and learning backend engineering concepts through real practice. Throughout the process, I used AI as a learning partner to understand backend patterns, improve my prompting skills, and explore how production-grade APIs are designed.\nThis project taught me how backend and frontend engineers collaborate through schemas, contracts, and predictable error structures. I learned how to design Prisma schemas, validate data with Zod, structure Fastify routes, and build a clean API that is easy for frontend developers to consume. The experience gave me a strong understanding of how backend logic works, why certain patterns exist, and how to design scalable, maintainable APIs.\nI also gained practical experience with deployment environments such as Railway, Render, and Vercel, learning how dev and prod differ in terms of cookies, CORS, headers, cold starts, and request lifecycles. These lessons helped me build a backend that behaves more like a real business-grade system rather than a simple demo.",

This experience exposed me to professional development workflows, production standards, and the expectations of high-quality frontend engineering.\n\nThe project is fully server-side rendered, which allowed me to discover the true power of Next.js and TypeScript in a real production environment. I contributed three of the main seven pages—Home, Projects, and Podcasts—along with two additional subpages inside the Projects section. Working on these pages helped me understand how to build scalable layouts, reusable UI patterns, and maintainable code structures.\n\nOne of the most valuable parts of this project was learning SEO fundamentals. I worked with structured data schemas, metadata optimization, and SEO testing after deployment. I also delivered a fully localized UI, ensuring both Arabic and English versions were polished and consistent.\n\nTheDeal also gave me hands-on experience integrating with a real API built by an experienced backend engineer. I implemented carousels, animated UI components, forms, and dynamic content, all while maintaining accessibility and performance. This project significantly boosted my confidence and made me even more eager to take on larger, more complex challenges.",
